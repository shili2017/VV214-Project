# VV214 Final Project
This repository belongs to UM-SJTU JI 2019SP VV214 (Linear Algebra) Group 11.

## Group Members
Liu Zeyuan - Mathematics calculation and graph constructing.

Shi Li - Coding and simulating.

Yuan Fangqi - Proposal and poster writing.

## How to run our model?
### Solution I
Run `main1.m` - One-direction road optimization (Solution I in the poster)

Key parameters including `THRESHOLD` can be modified in the source code.

### Solution II
Run `main2.m` - Shuttle bus optimization (Solution II in the poster)

Key parameters such as capacity of one bus can be modified in the source code.

## Details about our project
See "Proposal" and "Poster".
